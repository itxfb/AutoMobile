            <h2>3. Use of Services</h2>
            <p>CarBOXE does not always directly buy or sell cars or provide salvage and towing services or negotiate the purchase or sale of vehicles. In certain instances, the Website serves as a digital venue and intermediary where Sellers and Buyers meet and enter into agreements. In such situations, CarBOXE is not involved in the actual transaction between Sellers and Buyers (as defined below) and simply assists in the logistical and payment processes of the transactions when applicable. As a result, CarBOXE has no control over the quality, safety, or legal aspects of any sale that may be initiated through the use of the Website or Services. CarBOXE has a dealer's license that enables it to buy cars. In the instances where CarBOXE buys cars from a Seller, CarBOXE steps into the role of a Buyer and all terms and conditions applicable to a Buyer are applicable to CarBOXE.</p>
            <p>The Services provided are in no way a substitute for your own due diligence, and CarBOXE does not guarantee the accuracy or correctness of any information provided. You acknowledge that you may not accept an Offer (as defined below) on any vehicle that could cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation or that violates our Prohibited Items terms.</p>
            <p>While CarBOXE uses techniques such as insurance, EID, and credit checks to confirm the verification and qualification of Buyers and Carriers, it does not assume any obligation to do so and it does not guarantee the safety of any persons using the Website or Services or the accuracy of any information and is not responsible or liable for any activities you engage in with or any communications you have with Buyers or Carriers.</p>
            <p>In order to access or use the Services or access certain functionality of the Website, you may be required to provide current and accurate identification, a username, password, email address and other information. You are solely responsible for any information you provide to us or other users in the registration, Offer, transportation, or payment process. You represent and warrant that your personal information is true, legal, accurate, non-fraudulent and solely yours. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy and completeness of this information and for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information required to use the Services and Website. You may not impersonate, imitate or pretend to be somebody else when registering and/or setting up an account/profile on the Website. You acknowledge and agree that we may, and you specifically authorize us to, process all transactions, including any purchases, that are initiated by use of your registered account.</p>
            <p>You will be fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account with CarBOXE, including activities of others to whom you have provided your username or password.

            <h2>4. Offer</h2>
            <p>An "Offer" is an amount of money or service put forward by the Buyer and when accepted, is defined as a transaction between a Buyer and a Seller. Offers are contingent upon the accuracy of the vehicle information as well as personal information submitted by the Seller.</p>

            <h2>5. Seller</h2>
            <p>"Sellers" are users of CarBOXE who submit information about their vehicles in order to receive Offers from Buyers. When a Seller receives and accepts an Offer from a Buyer, they are connected with a Carrier to arrange for their vehicle to be picked up.</p>

            <h2>6. Buyer</h2>
            <p>"Buyers" are commercial users of CarBOXE who submit offer bids to buy the vehicles submitted by Sellers. The bid amount is based upon the vehicle's information that the Seller submits, such as the location, and condition of the vehicle. When a Buyer's bid is selected, an Offer is presented to the Seller.</p>
            <p>Buyers are not permitted to circumvent or "cut out" CarBOXE or make offers directly to Sellers outside of the Services. If an Offer made outside of CarBOXE’s Service is accepted by a Seller, then CarBOXE deems those offers outside its purview and is unable to provide any support or assistance to the Seller or Buyer.</p>

In the case of pickups, it is the Seller's responsibility to ensure that the vehicle is in a safe and accessible location to be removed upon the Carrier's arrival. If an Offer indicates that payment occurs at the moment the car is picked up, the Carrier also makes arrangements to pay the Seller.</p>
            <p>Carriers are not permitted to circumvent or "cut out" CarBOXE or make offers directly to Sellers outside of the Services. If an Offer made outside of CarBOXE's Services is accepted by a Seller, then CarBOXE deems those offers outside its purview and is unable to provide any support or assistance to the Seller or Carrier.</p>
